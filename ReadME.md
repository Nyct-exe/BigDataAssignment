# Running Instructions
Due to the complexity of the code, it is not recommended to run everything at the same time since it may take up to 30 minutes or more to finish depending on the hardware. It is recommended to run only the Decision tree, elbow and cluster_graphs functions to get all of the necessary data in the smallest amount of time.

## Togglable Settings
- data_wrapper.thirty_days_switch_removal(True/ False) is a togglable setting that decides whether the people who have been readmitted after 30 days should be removed or not. By default, it is set to True. (Explanation of why it is used is in the report)
